ngOnChanges: called after a bound input property changes
    -can be executed multiple times 
    right at the start when component is created and also called
    whenever our bound input properties changes (@Input properties - whenever
    they receive new values)

ngOnInit: Called once the component is initialized (kinda like component did mount)
    -hasnt been displayed yet on the dom
    -basic initialization and props are accessible now  (object was created)
    -runs after constructor

ngDoCheck: Called during every change detection run
    -runs multiple times (alot) bc it runs when change detection runs
    -change detection is system ang determines whether template changed inside the component
    -decides if the template needs to update basically
    -executed on every check angular makes (alot of times it runs bc you clicked even though
    it doesnt change anything. basically if any event/observable/timeout
    is emitted, this function runs)

ngAfterContentInit: called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view
    -called whenever the content is projected has been iniatlized 
    -not the component itself but the view of the parent component,
    especially the part thats added to the component with ng-content

ngAfterContentChecked: called every time the projected content has been checked
    -runs whenever change detection checked this content we are projecting into our component

ngAfterViewInit: called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized
    -once our view has been rendered

ngAfterViewChecked: called every time the view (and child views) have been checked
    -called whenever our view has been checked so once we are sure that 
    either all changes that needed to be done were displayed in view or
    no changes were detected by angular

ngOnDestroy: called once the component is about to be destroyed
    -great place to do cleanup bc object will be destroyed after angular
